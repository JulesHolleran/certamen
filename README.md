# certamen
I donâ€™t know the scope of the project, but it might be a nice feature if questions could somehow be flagged by level of difficulty (novice, intermediate, advanced) and possibly topic (language, history, mythology, Latin literature, customs, mottoes).  Here are several sources for a lot of Certamen questions:
